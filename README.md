Intended for personal progress. Will try my best to make readable code.

The only constant is change. It is very difficult to stay in touch with things I have learnt over the last few years without touching it once in a while. This repo will be just for that,
to stay in touch and hopefully learn something new as well in the mean time.

Projects won't be in this folder but specific snippets of learning will be.

Day 1 and 2- not much progress. Did some work related coding but still need to fix my Git issues on systems to continue this :(
